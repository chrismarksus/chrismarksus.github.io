Here I will be learning to cut and paste text in the terminal. This helps reduce typing if you find a command this close to the one you need and it just needs a few tweaks.

> I will be breaking this up into different parts as I learn these and build muscle memory. See Part 1, Part 2, and Part 4.

These are the key motions to cut and paste in the terminal:
* Cut from cursor to the end of line ```Ctrl``` + ```k```
* Cut from cursor to the end of word ```Alt``` + ```d```
* Cut from cursor to the start of word ```Alt``` + ```Backspace```
* Cut from cursor to previous whitespace ```Ctrl``` + ```w```
* Paste the last cut text ```Ctrl``` + ```y```

till next time!
