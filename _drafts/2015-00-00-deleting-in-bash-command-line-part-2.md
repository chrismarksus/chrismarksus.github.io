Here I will be learning to delete text in the terminal. This helps reduce typing if you find a command this close to the one you need and it just needs a few tweaks.

> I will be breaking this up into different parts as I learn these and build muscle memory. See Part 1, Part 3, and Part 4.

These are the key motions to delete text in the terminal:
* Delete one character backwards ```Backspace```
* Delete one character forwards. ```Ctrl``` + ```d```
* Undo. ```Ctrl``` + ```-```
* Clear the screen. ```Ctrl``` + ```l```

Hope this helps!
