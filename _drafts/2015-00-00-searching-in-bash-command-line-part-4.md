In order to adjust the text of a command for what you need now you need to be able to find it in the terminal history first.

You maybe asking why this was not first (or Part 1). Since I am write this for myself and I already know these key motions very well. I start with what I needed to learn first.

> I will be breaking this up into different parts as I learn these and build muscle memory. See Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.

These are the key motions for searching commands in the terminal history:
* Uses ```Ctrl``` + ```r``` to search for the last command in the history
* Repeat ```Ctrl``` + ```r``` to loop through the results
* Use ```Ctrl``` + ```j``` to select the current search result 
* To cancel the search and restore original line use ```Ctrl``` + ```g```

Have fun!
