I'm in the middle of a debate as to way the other persons IDE is so much better then the dumb editor I am using (Vim). So he mentions that he can put a cursor over a method and hit a key and it jump to the place that the method was created. I get around just fine with things like ```grep```, and ```find``` and ```vimgrep```. But not wanting Vim to be shown up I start reashing how to do it in Vim and found [ctags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags).
