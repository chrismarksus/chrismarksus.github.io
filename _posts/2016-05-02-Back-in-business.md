Well, I have been out of touch for a about a year. The house, the family, and the job have all been demanding my time.Also part of the problem is ruby, gems, and travis.

If you look at some of my builds like this [one](https://travis-ci.org/chrismarksus/chrismarksus.github.io/builds/127387783) and this [one](https://travis-ci.org/chrismarksus/chrismarksus.github.io/builds/127386907) you will see that even thou the gem in installed it still throws an error.

I will admit that I cheated and deleted the html-proofer line.
