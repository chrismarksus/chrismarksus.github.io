I have been getting tired of hit arrow keys to moving around in my commands in bash and was looking for a better way of working. After some research I found some key command that can speed things up.

These are the key motions to move around in the terminal:

* Move one character backwards ```Ctrl``` + ```b```
* Move one character forwards ```Ctrl``` + ```f```
* Move one word forwards ```Alt``` + ```f```
* Move one word backwards ```Alt``` + ```b```
* Move to the beginning of line ```Ctrl``` + ```a```
* Move to the end of line ```Ctrl``` + ```e```

Bye!
