My ruby environment has been messed up for a while now. I stumbled around prose.io and I am trying it out. We will see how it goes and I will give and update on it.

The first post I tried didn't work out so well. There was a double title. After messing with the post and controls I discovered that you needed to use the meta button to adjust the front matter. 

So far the controls are very simple and it would be a great editor for someone how is not very technical.
